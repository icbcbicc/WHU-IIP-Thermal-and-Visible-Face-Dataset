# WHU-IIP Thermal and Visible Face Dataset

**IMPORTANT: No image from the Dataset may be included as a figure in a publication unless expressly authorized by us.**

## Introduction
The **WHU-IIP Thermal and Visible Face Dataset** was introduced in the following paper:

Z. Wang, Z. Chen and F. Wu, "Thermal to Visible Facial Image Translation Using Generative Adversarial Networks," in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 25, no. 8, pp. 1161-1165, Aug. 2018, doi: 10.1109/LSP.2018.2845692.

This dataset contains 792 pairs of pixel-wise aligned thermal infrared and visible (RGB) face images of 33 individuals. Thermal infrared images are captured using the FLIR AX5 thermal camera. The original size of the visible and thermal images is 992 × 794 and 320 × 256, respectively. Both the original and face-aligned images are provided.

Note: The original link in the paper (iip.whu.edu.cn/projects/IR2Vis_dataset.html) was expired.
